# MNIST Database 

The MNIST Database is a collection of images of hand-written digits.
The actual data set itself can be downloaded at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ and can be uncompressed using `gunzip` to extract the files.

This is a package written to import the data and labels into a C++ program.
